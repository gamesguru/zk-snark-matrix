# Graphs

This module defines the basic DAG structures we will use for Kahn's topological sort.
We adopt a simple adjacency list or set representation.

## API Documentation

* `DirectedGraph`: A `structure` specifying a generic directed graph consisting of a set of
  vertices and an edge relation.
* `DirectedGraph.Reachable`: A `def` outlining the path between two vertices, establishing
  Reachable paths as an application of the `Relation.ReflTransGen` reflexive-transitive closure.
* `IsDAG`: A `class` asserting that a given graph is acyclic. (If a node `v` is reachable from
  `u` and `u` is reachable from `v`, then `u = v` — preventing cycles).

  edges : V → V → Prop

/-- A DAG is a directed graph with no cycles, meaning if `v` is reachable
from `u` and `u` is reachable from `v`, then `u = v`. -/
class IsDAG {V : Type u} (G : DirectedGraph V) : Prop where
  acyclic : ∀ (u v : V), G.Reachable u v → G.Reachable v u → u = v
